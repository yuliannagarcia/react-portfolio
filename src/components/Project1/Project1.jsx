                                         By implementing a fixed navigation bar at the bottom of the app, users will be able 
                                        to easily access and explore the app's features, resulting in a more intuitive user experience. 
                                        Unlike the hamburger menu, which can sometimes hide information and require users to go through 
                                        additional steps to find what they're looking for, a fixed navigation bar provides immediate 
                                        visibility and quick access to important functionalities such as emergency help or various ways 
                                        to support the homeless.

                                        Chunking information into smaller sections will improve usability of the app. Direct competitors like 
                                        Homeless Link and Refugees at Home lack clear separation between different types of information overwhelming readers. 
                                        By organising content into smaller, easily digestible sections, users will be able to navigate and 
                                        understand the app's offerings more efficiently.

                                        User journeys will be enhanced, ensuring clear CTAs, and making the app more accessible and usable for a wide range

                                    seeking support but also to provide a platform for people in need to easily find the 
                                    necessary assistance.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Volunteering was also highlighted as a crucial aspect by the participants. One individual 
                                    expressed that contributing time and effort to help others is a meaningful way to make a 
                                    difference, particularly for those who may not be in a position to offer financial support. 
                                    Another participant emphasized the importance of certain pages over others, suggesting that 
                                    while all pages are significant, those directly aimed at reducing the impact of homelessness 
                                    should take priority. As a result, I decided to include an access to help page and a 
                                    volunteering page as key features alongside the homepage.
                                </p>

                                <p> 
                                    Furthermore, feedback from participants underscored the importance of inclusivity in helping 
                                    reduce the risk of homelessness. This led me to conclude that language options should be available 
                                    within the app to cater to diverse user groups. Two participants specifically mentioned their 
                                    preference for Spanish over English, highlighting the need for multilingual support. Additionally, 
                                    one participant mentioned difficulties in processing information and emphasized the significance of 
                                    incorporating images and videos to facilitate better comprehension and navigation within the app. 
                                    Another participant suggested the inclusion of a map feature to provide directions and instructions 
                                    on accessing help or volunteering locations.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In summary, based on the insights gained from the red route analysis, the app will prioritise an 
                                    accessible help page, a volunteering page, and multilingual support. Incorporating visual aids, such 
                                    as images and videos, will enhance user experience and comprehension. Furthermore, the inclusion of a 
                                    map feature will assist users in finding locations for assistance and volunteering opportunities. 
                                    These findings will guide the next phase of research, focusing on further understanding the specific 
                                    content and functionalities desired within the help and volunteering pages.

                            After conducting a card sorting activity with my family members, I have gained insights 
                            on how to organise the information for the home, volunteering, and access to help pages, 
                            which were identified as the key focus areas from the red route analysis. Based on the 
                            results, I have reorganised the information as follows:

                            By using these low fidelity wireframes as a foundation, I can ensure that the final design will 
                            exhibit a cohesive visual identity. This approach simplifies the development process, as I can 
                            reuse design components and establish consistent interaction patterns, ultimately resulting in 
                            a more user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing app.

                <p>
                            To provide a consistent and user-friendly experience, my app will maintain the same 
                            layout and style across its different pages. This approach ensures that users can easily 
                            navigate and interact with the app without confusion. To achieve this consistency, 
                            I have created low fidelity wireframes for the home, volunteering, and help pages, 
                            which share the same overall design but have different content.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By adopting a consistent layout and style, users will quickly become familiar with the app's 
                            interface, allowing them to navigate through various sections seamlessly. This uniformity 
                            also facilitates user understanding and reduces the learning curve as they transition between 
                            different pages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the content may vary on each page, the shared design elements will provide a sense of 
                            continuity and familiarity. Users will appreciate the predictability and find it easier to 
                            locate relevant information or perform desired actions across different sections of the app.

                                            Thy Neighbour follows not only the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 
                                            (WCAG) and user interface (UI) laws but also takes into account the principles 
                                            of Hick's Law to create an inclusive and user-friendly experience. By considering 
                                            the Hick's Law, we have carefully optimized the decision-making process for users, 
                                            minimizing cognitive load and enhancing efficiency.

                                            In terms of WCAG compliance, we have implemented features like alternative text 
                                            for images, ensuring that visually impaired users can access descriptive information.
                                            Additionally, we have prioritized a clear and consistent navigation structure, 
                                            reducing the number of choices presented at any given time. This aligns with Hick's 
                                            Law, as it helps users make decisions more swiftly by minimizing the cognitive effort 
                                            required.
                                        </p>  
                                        <p>
                                            To meet UI laws, we have paid special attention to color contrast. By employing color 
                                            checkers and adhering to the recommended contrast ratios, we ensure that the text and 
                                            background colors provide sufficient differentiation. This promotes legibility and 
                                            accessibility for individuals with visual impairments. Furthermore, we have designed 
                                            resizable text options to accommodate users who may require larger or smaller text sizes 
                                            for optimal readability.

                        Throughout the design process, we have conducted extensive user testing and gathered 
                        feedback from diverse user groups. This approach ensures that our app meets the needs and 
                        preferences of all users, regardless of their abilities or limitations. By adhering to both 
                        WCAG and UI laws, while considering Hick's Law, our homeless app delivers an inclusive digital 
                        experience. It promotes accessibility, minimizes decision-making barriers, and provides equal 
                        access to vital resources for individuals experiencing homelessness.

                            In conclusion, my UX design project on creating a homeless ad has been successful in many ways. The ad was 
                            able to effectively communicate the message and raise awareness about homelessness, ultimately achieving 
                            its intended purpose. The user experience was carefully considered, resulting in a design that was intuitive,
                            accessible, and engaging for the target audience.
                        </p>

                            However, it is important to acknowledge that the project could have been even more successful with the assistance 
                            of a dedicated team knowledgeable in UX design. Collaborating with experts in the field would have allowed for 
                            valuable insights and perspectives, enabling more informed decisions throughout the design process. Consulting 
                            with a UX design team would have helped identify potential usability issues, optimize user flows, and ensure
                            that the final product truly met the needs and expectations of the users.

                        <p>
                            Furthermore, having more resources available for conducting wider research would have greatly enhanced the 
                            project's effectiveness. A comprehensive research phase could have provided valuable insights into the specific 
                            needs and challenges faced by homeless individuals, allowing for a more tailored and impactful design. It could 
                            have involved conducting user interviews, observations, and usability testing to gather user feedback and refine 
                            the design based on real-world insights.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Despite these limitations, the success of the project highlights the importance of UX design in creating meaningful 
                            and impactful experiences. It also serves as a valuable learning experience, emphasizing the significance of 
                            collaboration, expertise, and adequate resources in achieving the best possible outcomes. Moving forward, these 
                            lessons can be applied to future projects, ensuring a more comprehensive and effective UX design process.
